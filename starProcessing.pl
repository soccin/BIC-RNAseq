### input is sam file from star
### removes 1.) alignments with isize > (2^31)-1 = 2,147,483,647 
### because this causes error in picard size isize is an int
###         2) alignments where read length does not match qual length; seems to be a problem in star
###         3) where there aren't enough fields (have that as 11 right now; through quals)
