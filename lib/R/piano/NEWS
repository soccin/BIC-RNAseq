    o Added argument plot to consensusHeatmap() so that drawing the heatmap can
      be suppressed but the corresponding numerical matrix can be saved.

    o Added argument cellnote to consensusHeatmap() so that the information inside
      each cell of the heatmap can be chosen to be either the consensus scores (as
      previously), the median p-values, the number of genes or empty.

      same information as printed in the heatmap if argument cellnote="nGenes".

      for better control of the column labels, toggling of the colorkey, color 
      selection and text size.

      but for only a single gene set result (gsaRes object).

      and downregulated genes in the gene sets.

-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added argument ncpus to runGSA(). Enables parts of this function to run in

    o Added function runGSAhyper() to perform gene set analysis using Fisher's exact test,
      as an alternative to runGSA.

    o Added information about genes in each area of the Venn diagram in the output
      of diffExp().

    o Added volcano plot as optional output of diffExp() and added argument volcanoFC.

    o Added argument ncharLabel to networkPlot() and consensusHeatmap() to control the 
      length of the labels in the plots and add the option to not truncate them.

    o Added the yeast metabolic model iTO977 to be loaded with loadGSC(), for detecting 
      reporter metabolites using gene set analysis. (See vignette.)

    o Added support for running networkPlot() on objects returned by runGSAhyper().
