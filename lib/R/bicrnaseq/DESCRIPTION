Maintainer: Caitlin Jones <byrne@cbio.mskcc.org>
Description: All things RNASeq, as implemented by the Bioinformatics Core. Includes
    wrappers around a variety of methods for read counting, normalization, 
    differential expression analysis, and visualization. NOTE: this is the
    first iteration of this package and most functions are currently written
    to be used specifically within the BIC RNASeq pipeline. Plans for future 
    versions include more flexible functions that will be able to be used
    independently of the pipeline.

        data.table, RColorBrewer, plyr, reshape, ggplot2, grid,
