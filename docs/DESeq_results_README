ImportRNASeqMatrixToExcel.docx
 If any of the *.xls files is opened simply by double-clicking, it is possible that 
 Excel will automatically convert some gene symbols to dates. This file explains 
 how to avoid this.  

The following subfolders contain the results for this project.

metrics 
    -- raw metrics from GATK and RSeQC
    -- qc metrics report in pdf format

gene-level analysis: 
gene\alignments 
    -- raw STAR alignments for each sample 

gene\clustering 
        -- hierarchical clustering of all samples using RNASeq counts normalized using DESeq
        -- multidimentional scaling (MDS) of samples using RNASeq counts normalized using DESeq
        -- dispersion estimate plot of mean normalized gene counts vs dispersion value for each condition
        -- heatmap showing relative expression of the 50 genes with the highest average counts across samples
        -- heatmap showing similarities/distance between all pairwise samples
        -- pca plot showing the first two principal components of all samples

gene\counts_gene 
    -- raw htseq count files for each sample and a single file that contains all gene counts from all samples 
    -- normalized counts for all genes and samples, scaled using DESeq method and genes with mean counts less than 15 in both conditions were filtered out (counts_scaled_DESeq.xls) 

gene\all_gene
     -- files with the fold-changes (log2 scale), p-value, adjusted p-values, and mean counts in each condition for all genes 

gene\differentialExpression_gene 
    -- results only for genes meeting fold change cutoff log2(2), adjusted p-value cutoff 0.05, and mean coverage of at least 15; note, genes with count 0 in one condition are also included even though p-values are not significant 
    -- heatmap showing relative expression of the most significantly differentially expressed genes, up to 100 genes
    -- scatter plot of log2 fold changes (y-axis) vs the mean of normalized counts (x-axis) 
    -- histogram of p-values for all genes

gene\gsa
    -- results from gene set analysis using the Piano R package
